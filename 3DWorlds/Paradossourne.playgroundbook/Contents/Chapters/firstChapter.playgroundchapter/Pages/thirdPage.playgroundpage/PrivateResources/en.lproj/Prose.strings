"FirstProseBlock" = "We calculated the probability of extracting two white balls with re-inserting, both with strategy 1 and strategy 2, illustrated on the first page, in a particular case and the best strategy seems to be the second one that chooses once and for all the urn and re-pocketing two balls from the same bag.

----------------------------------------------------------

Now change the code already written on the previous page to repeat the experiment with different balls compositions. You have to change the number of white and black balls  and, subsequently, to calculate which of the two strategies turns out to be the best.

-----------------------------------------------------------


You can copy and paste the code already written on the previous page and modify it in order to:
- repeat the experiment with a number of balls chosen by you and then you will have to manually initialize the variables each time;
- repeat the experiment with a number of random balls generated by the system and then you will have to initialize the variables with the instruction nomeVariabile = Double (random.nextInt ());

";

"SecondProseBlock" = "You should have noticed that the winning strategy is ALWAYS the second regardless of the number of balls.

It's strange and there is no justification for this behavior, that's why it's called PARADOX.

Let's try to show that this behavior occurs in every situation. Go to the next page.";
