"FirstProseBlock" = "Let's start with a particular case. We suppose you have two bags, one with 5 black balls and 5 white balls, the other with 10 black and 2 white balls.

We then calculate the probability of extracting two white balls with re-inserting, both prior with strategy 1 and then with strategy 2, these strategy are illustrated on the previous page.

----------------------------------------------------------

We use four variables to contain the number of white and black balls in each urn, respectively. Then we calculate the probabilities of the requested events bearing in mind that:
- I will choose an urn between two at random with a probability of 0.5
- I will calculate the probability of an event by dividing the number of favorable cases by the number of possible cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------

After making the necessary calculations we assign, for a correct visualization of the results, the probability of extracting two white balls adopting the first strategy to probStr1 and the probability of extracting two white balls adopting the second strategy to probStr2 (the two variables -probStr1 and probStr2- have already been declared )";

"SecondProseBlock" = "In this case the best strategy seems to be the second one, that is to choose once and for all the urn and extract with re-inserting two balls from the **same** urn.
-------------------------------------------------- ------------

It is interesting to understand if it is a particular case or if we arrive at the same conclusion also by changing the composition of the ballot boxes.";
