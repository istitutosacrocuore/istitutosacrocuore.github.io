"FirstProseBlock" = "Let us indicate with b 'and n' the white and black balls of the first bag, with b '' and n '' the white and black balls of the second bag.
The probability of extracting a white ball from the first urn will be α = b '/ (b' + n ')
The probability of extracting a white ball from the second urn will be β = b '' / (b '' + n '')

We can so derive the probability of extracting two white balls with the first and with the second strategy which we indicate respectively with P 'and P' '.

To determine which is greater we study the difference.

It is clear that this difference is always greater than or equal to zero !!!

So we have shown something curious at first sight, namely that the answer does NOT depend on the assignment of the numbers b ', b' '.

**This confirms that before making a decision it is appropriate to reflect and calculate the probability of the events in play, without letting ourselves be influenced by first impressions, not always correct.**";
